# FPL-Season-Predict
This is a data formatting and machine learning project using Fantasy Premier League Data from [Anand Vaastav's FPL Data](https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League). This project uses stats for a given player from a previous season to predict their total fantasy points for the current season.
# Struggles and Goals
One struggle with this project is finding a way to make it more accurate. The correlation between a players last season and their current one is important but can be greatly differing to the point that machine learning cannot fully learn its patterns. One way I hope to mitigate this is by adding categorical data such as a players name, team, or position, into embedding layers so that hopefully the network can learn more from that.
## Other Projects
1. [Fantasy Game Week Predictor](https://github.com/StrawberryFigbar/FPL-GameWeek-Predict): A fantasy points predictor used for making captain and transfer decisions.
2. [Neural Network](https://github.com/StrawberryFigbar/Neural_Network): A neural network created from scratch that gives a better example of how these network work.
